This is a brief demonstration of using the rspec block syntax to
verify message arguments.

The class under test is the UserBuilder class, at `user_builer.rb`.
The script `main.rb` demonstrates how this class might be called:

> ruby main.rb

The demonstration of the RSpec block syntax can be seen in
`user_builder_spec.rb`, which can be executed as

> rspec user_builder_spec.rb
